                    Hi all! I'm Rodnee. I was born in Denver, CO but have been in Phoenix since March of 2006.
                I'm an avid sports fan; I still support my Denver teams. Die hard Bronco fan! Played a little college
                football back in the day at Idaho State University. I was a defensive-back. I love the Colorado
                Rockies, Denver Nuggets, and Colorado Avalanche as well. I also love to play golf! I'm in the right
                city
                for that! I have around a 10 handicap.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm almost finished with a Master's degree in Cybersecurity; and I'm adding to my toolbelt with this
                class. I love to learn technology, and am sure this class will really help me find that career I'm
                hoping for.
                <br>
                I'm a single guy with an older brother, younger sister and brother.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, I drive for Lyft and Uber. Between my twp "schools" I don't have time to work -full-time;
                and this way I have good flexibility. I can work when I want, or rather, when I can. The flexibility
                is important, as I value my performance in school. It's also nice to set my own hours, and be my own
                boss.
                I'm pretty easy on myself! It works out well on class days. Because I live way up in Desert Ridge, I
                just
                work during the day; and when it gets to be afternoon, set my destination for Gilbert. That way, by the
                time
                class starts I'm already nearby, and was paid to get to class!
